PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)
======================================
Project: Squad Empowerment – Decision Support Module
Bank: Halyk Bank Super App
Squad: Cross-functional product squad (Procurement Journey)
Version: 1.0
Date: 2026-02-17

--------------------------------------
CONTEXT
--------------------------------------
Product squads at Halyk Bank are formally organized as Agile teams but operate
under Management Board–driven roadmaps, centralized discovery functions, and
multi-committee approval gates. This creates a gap between squad accountability
and squad authority.

This PRD defines the minimum requirements for a Decision Support Module that
enables squads to act as empowered product owners within defined risk boundaries.

--------------------------------------
JOB TO BE DONE (JTBD)
--------------------------------------
When I am responsible for improving a customer journey within the Halyk Super App,
I want the ability to independently discover problems, test solutions, and make
product decisions within defined risk boundaries,
So that my squad can deliver measurable customer and business outcomes without
excessive governance delays.

--------------------------------------
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------

REQUIREMENT 1 — Risk-Calibrated Escalation (ID: FR-001)
  The module MUST analyze proposed product changes against predefined risk and
  compliance rules. It MUST flag ONLY high-risk initiatives for committee
  escalation. Low-risk and medium-risk changes must be auto-approved within the
  squad's authority boundary. Flagging all changes for escalation regardless of
  risk level is a CRITICAL FAILURE of this requirement.

REQUIREMENT 2 — Explainable Recommendations (ID: FR-002)
  The module MUST provide human-readable, explainable recommendations for each
  decision. Each recommendation must reference the specific internal policy or
  OKR it is aligned to. Generic or unexplained outputs are NOT acceptable.

REQUIREMENT 3 — Real-Time Customer Signal Aggregation (ID: FR-003)
  The module MUST aggregate real-time customer feedback, in-app behavioral data,
  and usage signals. It MUST NOT rely solely on periodic Brand Health Tracking
  reports (which are delayed by weeks). Absence of a real-time feedback
  aggregation mechanism is a CRITICAL FAILURE of this requirement.

REQUIREMENT 4 — OKR-to-Outcome Translation (ID: FR-004)
  The module MUST translate high-level business OKRs into measurable product
  outcomes. It must track customer impact metrics (e.g., task completion rate,
  drop-off reduction) rather than feature delivery counts.

--------------------------------------
PASS / FAIL CRITERIA
--------------------------------------
- Score >= 75: PASS (squad may proceed with delivery)
- Score < 75:  FAIL (escalation to Product Chapter required)
- Any CRITICAL FAILURE in FR-001 or FR-003 automatically sets status to FAIL
  regardless of total score.
